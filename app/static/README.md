# README: /static

## Ownership
Milo Bengtsson is responsible for the CSS.


## Status
* Stylesheet still not implemented through Sass.
* Will have to implement it through normal CSS.


## Purpose
The files in this folder are static, i.e. are not extendable and do not change their content depending on what file calls them. 

## To Do
[] Media queries (e.g. .container-section to take up entire width on smaller screens *and* not have `top: 25%;` declared)
